## The Work 

Here's a list of resources to get you going. Once you complete these, you will have grasped the essential ways Ruby does things and will be ready for bigger and better things, like building for the web!

#### First Things First

* ["Ruby in 100 minutes"](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html), a fast and fairly complete introduction to the different building blocks of Ruby, its built-in data structures, objects, and more.
* *[Beginning Ruby](books/Beginning\ Ruby.pdf)*, by Peter Cooper. Read and write the code (some will be a bit old so may need updating, use your judgement. But it remains an absolute treasure.)
* Complete exercises in [Part 1](main_challenges/set_1/part-1) folder of the Set 1 Prep work.
* Complete [Week 1](main_challenges/main_challenges_phase_1/week-1-exercises) folder of the main_challenges Set 2 Phase 1 folder. Use the phase guide to ensure you're doing exercises in the right order!

#### A Bit More

* Complete exercises in [Part 2](main_challenges/set_1/part-2) folder of the Set 1 Prep work. Don't skip the readings!
* Complete [Week 2](main_challenges/main_challenges_phase_1/week-2-exercises) folder of the main_challenges Set 2 Phase 1 Prep work. Use the phase guide to ensure you're doing exercises in the right order!
* Complete the [Test First Ruby](test-first-ruby/README.md) exercises.
* *[The Well-Grounded Rubyist](books/The\ Well-Grounded\ Rubyist.pdf)*, by David A. Black
* [Interactive Regular Expressions tutorial](https://regexone.com/)
* [Ruby Koans](koans/README.rdoc). Their site is [here](http://rubykoans.com/) if you aren't sure how to get started.

#### The Meat and Potatoes

* [Kickstart Ruby](ruby-kickstart/README.mdown), specifically Session 1, Session 2, and Session 3. Their site is [here](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart).
* Complete exercises in [Part 3](main_challenges/set_1/part-3) folder of the Set 1 Prep work. Don't skip the readings!
* [Complete all the algorithms in this list.](https://github.com/mindplace/ongoing-study/blob/master/algorithms/practice-algorithms.md). As you solve them, [write your own RSpec tests](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs) for them.

#### Let's take the next step: writing to files, databases, internet, and beyond!

* Complete [Week 3](main_challenges/main_challenges_phase_1/week-3-exercises) folder of the main_challenges Set 2 Phase 1 folder. Use the phase guide to ensure you're doing exercises in the right order!
* [MicroBlogger](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html)
